# road-to-quant
This repo documents my journey into quantitative finance through small, focused projects inspired by concepts taught in *Quantitative Portfolio Management* by Michael Isichenko.

## Backstory
Although I don't come from a quantitative background, I am deeply drawn to quant finance because:
- It uses data to forecast asset prices.
- It allows me to apply my programming skills in a meaningful way.
- It represents a challenging intellectual pursuit.

On the 2nd May 2025, I bought the book *Quantitative Portfolio Management* by Michael Isichenko to get properly started on this journey. My earlier interest in quant finance led me to explore topics like CAPM, mean-variance optimization, and risk metrics, but mostly through self-guided experimentation in Python. While my initial understanding was limited, the tools I built—especially Drapt Analytics—proved to be both functional and personally rewarding.


This time, my goal is to approach quant finance with both theory and practical implementation. Even if I don't end up working as a quant, I believe that intellectual curiosity is always time well spent.
